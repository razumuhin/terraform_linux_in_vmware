# terraform_linux_in_vmware
create linux vm in vmware via terraform

The terraform files found here allow you to create one or more linux machines in your vmware environment.
(change the variables according to your own environment.)
First, create an ssh key and make a note of the public key. (When you apply terraform, it will ask you for this key)
